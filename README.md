# SeismicUnixAddOns
My add-on modules to the [Seismic Unix](http://www.cwp.mines.edu/cwpcodes/) seismic processing package. 

The modules were written during my work at READ Well Services which was specialized on processing and imaging of multi-component
VSP and OBC seismic data. Some modules are SU programs with extended functionality and therefore keep the same prefix 'su'. Many new modules are created as parts of the in-house processing system called SPRINT and therefore have the prefix 'sp'.

More detailed documentation will follow....
